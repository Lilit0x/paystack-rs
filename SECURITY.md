## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please open an issue with the following details:
- Nature of the vulnerability
- Severity level (could be based on your opinion)
- How to replicate it
- Version of the client that has it

This project is still being maintained by a single individual so I will implement the fix as fast as I can.
